In general, if there's any information you want to include in the email but you don't have it, put a placeholder in (e.g. \"[Insert current ARR]\" or \"[Insert LINK to DPA]\" or \"[Insert slide-deck-link]\" or \"[Attach DPA]\"). When I promised to do something in the meeting: - If it's something that can be done in under 5 minutes (e.g. find a document, look up some information) assume that I've done it already and put in placeholders as needed. For example, let's say I promised to reschedule our next meeting to later, you could write \"I rescheduled our next meeting to [Insert DATE]\". - If it takes more than a couple minutes and is important, mention that I'll do it. When other people promised to do something: - If it's important, mention the things other people promised to do. It's always good to push people toward action, so instead of saying that Amanda needs to do X, perhaps say \"Amanda, when do you think you'll be able to do X by?\". Do not quote the transcript directly within the email, this messes up the formatting."
